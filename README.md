# Power-Bi-Business-Insights-360

Problem Statement:

Previously AtliQ was doing analysis in Microsoft Excel itself but now the company has expanded its operations in different regions and has a large amount of data to perform analysis and to take data-driven business decisions.

Solution:

As a Data Analyst, I have created a report using Power BI. I have created 5 different dashboards in this report. 4 for individual departments and 1 dashboard for the Executives to track different KPIs from all the departments to get an overview of the business performance and overall health of the business.

1). Finance View : Analyzed financial performance across markets, product and customers. Featured a dynamic P&L statements, Net Sales, Gross Margin %, Net Profit % and breakdown of top/bottom products & Customers by Net Sales.

2). Sales View : For sales team Gross Margin and Net Sales are more important than profit as typically they have least or no control over operating expense. So, Conducted in depth analysis of customers and products performance, region/market insights, and presented a matrix for gross margin and net sales and unveiled unit economics.

3). Marketing View : Conducted in depth analysis of customers and products performance, region/market insights, and presented a matrix for gross margin and net sales and unveiled unit economics.

4). Supply Chain View : Provided a valuable metrics for customers and products, alongside a detailed net sales error analysis. Contributed to improved sales accuracy and identified areas for enhancement.

5). Executive View : Showcased subzone-level market share trends, revenue breakdown by division and channel specific metrics.
